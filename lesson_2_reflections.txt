What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	The files needed for Git to do it's thing are created.  You need it so that

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging is where your changes are bundled up before they're ready to be

	I like the staging area because you can double-check your work before
	making the commit final.
