When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In the case that you want to make your code more readily available to other
    people or if you need to make sure that the code in your local repo isn't 
    lost if it gets physically destroyed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If there are lots of conflicts on the remote you are forced to deal with
    them instead of working on your code in peace.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a way to clone a repo on GitHub that you do not have permission to
    make changes to.  You're essentially making a clone on GitHub that has
    information about the original baked in.  Clone is just a copy of a repo.
    A branch is an extension of a repo where it retains history and you can 
    make additional changes that don't impact the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    There will be potentially fewer manual merges needed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would probably use a shared drive like Dropbox.  I could email files to
    other people.  Lastly I could put the code on a USB drive and walk it or
    deliver it to someone.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
